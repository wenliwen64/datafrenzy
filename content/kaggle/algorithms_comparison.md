This note is dedicated to comparing different supervised machine learning algorithms which will usually used in Kaggle competitions. 

# Some overview points
- - -
Some aspects you have to consider about what model to choose:

    i. Number of features;
 
    ii. Number of samples;

    iii. Amount of noises;
  
    iv. Wethear the data is linearly separable or not;


Five main steps to train a algorithm:
    
    i. Selection of features;
  
    ii. Choosing a performance metric;
  
    iii. Choosing a classifier or algorithm;

    iv. Evaluating an algorithm;

    v. Tuning an algorithm.
