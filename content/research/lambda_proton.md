# Data
- - - 
* Period 5: Giant:/media/Disk_Yan/liwen/Run11_200GeV/ && Giant:/home/lwen/(this location should be changed to old_home after last August we changed the hard drive) && Giant:/media/Liwen/Run11_200GeV/ 

* [Feng Zhao's files location]({filename}/data/feng_files.txt)

## Upstream:
   * Location: rcf:/star/u/lwen1990/gpfs/v2_Lambda_200GeV/batchjobs/generate_Period1.sh
   * Note: Every time you update your source code or change your location, you have to update the version number in `Scheduler_new.xml` to make it work as expected. 

# Log
- - -
* 2016-02-03: $Lambda$-p correlation

* 2016-02-04: We need to add new bad run for $Lambda$-p correlation

* 2016-02-08: Begin running code to generate data for PEriod 1 on rcf(day132-140, 126-128 undone yet).
