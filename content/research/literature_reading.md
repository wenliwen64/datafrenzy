# General topic in heavy ion collisions

* Science 332 1525, Nu's comparison between STAR's result and Lattice QCD to derive $T_c$. Basically use the suscepibility analysis to compare one-parameter($T_c$) model calculation to finally find out the most fit parameter.

# Strangeness production

* [The tale of the Hagedorn temperature](http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28919) explains the concept of Hagedorn tmeparature in the context of hadron collisions and extend it to Quark Matter phase. SBM(strapbost model) is sucessful in predicting the particle productions in hadron collisions. But why there is no absolute hot temperature?
