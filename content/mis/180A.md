# Experiment I. Cosmic rays

  * Sometime the two coincidence counts are even lower than three coincidence counts when the high voltage is going up. The reason is one of the square wave generated by the coincidence is too wide from two coincidence so that it may submerge other signals which may finally decrease the counts.  


# Experiment II. Half life measurement

  * The board is not working due to the controller failure(VM0018). 

# Experiment III. Beta decay spectrum

  * How to pump the air: close the vent connected to the solenoid chamber; open the valve to the pump; turn on the mechanical pump.

  * How to close the pump: close the vent connected to the pump first; open the vent to the air; wait until the air fills the chamber; 
turn off the pump.

  * Apply high volts to the Geiger Counter.

  * Turn on the fan when you turn on the shunt voltage.

  * Run for like 2 mins so that the counts can be at least approximately equal to last year's data.
 
# Log

  * 2016-02-08: File the return form, the return number(Product-Return-Number, PRN) is W7389, received email.

  * 2016-02-10: We can download the form from Ernie's email, and fill out the monique's email and Joey's signature and Huang's account.

     1. I tried to upgrade the firmware in C2/P2 FPGA to the latest version but failed;

     2. The old Dell laptop can be connected through the serial port of the MCA(multichannel analyzer); you can tune the port(COM) and sample rate in the `View->preference` and select the MCA tab;

     3. George's old samsung laptop can be used through usb connector, you have to download the recentest software and install the Prolific usb driver which is included in the software package. And then find out the COM number in `Task Manager` and change the settings in the `admca`(software's name) preference. But, the data acquisition is very very very slow(software usually gets frozen), never succeeded obtaining a full spectrum.

     4. Asked Andreas from Wiener to send us a spare VM-USB controller for testing. The PK3B-180A(shipping funding account for department use) is obtained from Leticia and PK21(444025-HU-22446-03) is the account number for our group's research use(DOE).

   * 2016-02-18: Andreas sent out the module and the tracking number is 775681057419.

      1. Today is a day worth celebration. New module arrives and works like a charm.

      2. In the morning, I opened the package and install it(by pushing it very hard into the crate, using the handles) to the horizontal crate, then installed the TDC V.775(obtained from Huang) in the crate also. Use the XXUSBWin software(latest version as of today) to access itself's registers(by checking the self in the third tab("stack commands??"), and input the register's address on the controller board. A32 is a 4 bytes long(8 digits of hexadecimal number) addressing mode, the AM mode is not abllowed to set manually(they are corresponding to some special modes of data acquisition, check the manul for detailed description)). By accessing the 803A register of TDC V.775 or QDC V.965, you are supposed to get result `3`. But you have to click the 2,3 bytes to read the data in the software(If you read manual carefully, the module's addrress goes up by like 4 for each register which corresponds to 4bytes = 32 bits, but the 803A register has only 16 bits of data, which are siting in the final two bytes, so you have to use 2,3).  

     3. Big endian vs. little endian: big endian is the most significant digit is in the lowest address, and the little endian is the opposite. 

     4. I upgraded the C3/P3 firmware on the new module VM0050.

     5. In the afternoon when I tested the new module with Jed with the real data input, one thing intersting happens, when the number of input is only one for coincidence then even the OR logic is not working at all. If we set the FIFO option to 13k, it will stops acquisition after like 30s for Na22 source put close enough to Abel.

     6. So the address is `EE110000` for V.965 and you also have to change it in the command stack window on the graphic interface. (In summary, you have to change four items including `FIFO options`(4k) and Serial Number(VM0018 to VM0050))

     7. For calibration, run 300s for each combination of detector and source. 

     8. No need to use logic unit in calibration, but you can use it in the final bg data-taking.
   
     9. No Barium source found in the cabinet. (Found in a silver collimator, red button.)

     10. How to debug the `DRDY` and `BUSY` lights both on symptoms? Change FIFO(deep reason not known yet).

     11. The code version of V965 is not working(cannot generate txt file).  

     12. The gate generator output should go to gate on V.965 and VM-USB I1.   

     13. <del>Send out the documentation of the data structure and office hour.</del>

     14. Green high volts on white board are the proper set of high volts. (A-1400V, B-1050V, C-1550V, F-1150V)

     1. Today we checked Abel's raw signal, and it is not good. Probably we need to replace it with a new one.

     2. I mistakenly used Sodium22 as the source in Compton Scattering experiment which should use Co60.

     1. I put the bricks on two sides of the isotope to obtain well-defined beam from the source. Otherwise, we get quite broadly distributed blobs. In each detector's spectrum, you can even observe Co-60 double peaks.

     2. We get very very few events from Abel at angle 30. Theoretically, it should have the most counts but no! We observed very crappy signal leading edge from Abel's output.  

     3. MCA 8000A is not working well. I put it with associated cables in the CAEN box on the shelf.

     4. We should use very short wires to wire up the electronics in Exp4.

     5. Forward scattering gamma will be filtered out by the threshold on Fixed detector(small energy deposited in Fixed), we need to change the discriminator's threshold to very low level.

     1. I changed the A-F and C-F coincidence channel, but no difference, A-F coincidence rate is still extremely low. Checked the width of the coincidence signal, but it is normal(~57ns, but sometime ~120ns). The only reason I can tell should be the deformation of the raw signal of Abel makes descriminator output delayed by some time so finally we cannot get any effective coincidence.

Notes:

     1. We need a multimeter!

     2. Batteries for pulsar.

     1. Count the time of the counting! We need that rate to compute the cross-section.
