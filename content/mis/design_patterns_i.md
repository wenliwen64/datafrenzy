# Chapter 1: Introduction

* Differences between experienced software designer and novice:
    1. Do not to solve every problem from first principles;
    2. 

* A pattern has four essential elements:
  
   1. Pattern name;

   2. The problems describing when to apply the pattern;

   3. The solution describing the elements that make up the design, relationships, responsibilities and collaborations

   4. The consequences(a system's flexibility, extensibility or portability) are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern. 

* Design pattern definition in this book: descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problems in a particular context. 

* Model/View/Controller(MVC) pattern

* Dynamic binding: the run-time association of a request to an object and one of its operations

* Polymorphism: it lets a client object make few assumptions about other objects beyond supporting a particular interface. 

* Principles in object-oriented design: 

   1. Program to an interface , not an implementation;

   2. Favor object composition over class inheritance;

   notes: interface: what users see; implementation: all the dirty work you do.
