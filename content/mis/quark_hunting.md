1. $K_0$ has strangeness +1 while $\Lambda^0$ having -1;

2. Kaon and pion or three pions resonances are constituting the vector mesons with spin-1, because it has preferred direction in space.

3. Kstar-kaonpion, Rho-pionpion, omega-pionpionpion, these are three vector mesons which were discovered earliest
